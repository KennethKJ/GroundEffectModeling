# Sound Propagation Modelling Software
Software to calculate the attenuation of sounds transmitted outdoors with 
the focus on animal acoustic communication in natural habitats. Currently,
only open field habitats can be modeled like natural grassland, lawn, 
farm fields, and the like as long as the ground properties are known
and provided, and there are no tree or other larger structures present
along the transmission path or in close proximity.

The sound reflected from the ground and its acoustic properties is
very important in this respect as well as atmospheric attenuation and 
conditions. These are all taken into account in the software.

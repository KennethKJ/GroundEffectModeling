# Ground Calc
Software to calculate the attenuation of sounds transmitted outdoor
The sound reflected from the ground and its acoustic properties is
very important in this respect as well as atmospheric attenuation and 
conditions. These are all taken into account in the software.

The software can be used to predict, within certain limitations,
the acoustic conditions under which animals are communicating.
